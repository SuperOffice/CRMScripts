# CRMScripts

This repository contains an opensource library of CRMScripts. Most script are created by and for the community. The purpose is to make it easier to reuse code between projects.

The Library folder contains scripts that are intended to be included in scripts you're building. For each script in the Library there is a corresponding example in the Library/Examples folder describing usage.
